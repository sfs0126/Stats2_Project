Multiple Linear Regression and Multiple Logistic Regression using Framingham Heart Study Dataset

CAP 5302, Project: What Is Expected during Presentations

In your presentation, you will need to address the following tasks:

0. Shortly describe your data, following with research questions you expect to potentially answer via application of models/methods introduced in this course. See further bullet points to get a rough idea of what kind of analyses are expected eventually, BUT don’t feel completely tied in to it, especially in case you have very specific ideas of how you’d like to proceed, and would like to possibly take it outside the range of materials covered in this course. It’s always important to think in the “question =⇒ methods” approach, rather than the other way around, but outlining certain “minimum expectations” is still important for evaluation purposes within the framework of this course, and might help those of you who don’t quite know how/where to start. We can always discuss and re-arrange these expectations depending on specific research questions you’d like an answer to.

1. Conduct some descriptive analysis on the data, visualizing relationships between variables.

2. Study the relationship between two categorical variables based on methods learnt earlier in this course.

3. Fit an appropriate basic multiple linear regression model (only first-order terms, no polynomials or interactions), using all the tools learnt in class:
• Check for model significance 
• Variable selection
• Checking for collinearity
Interpret the results (quality-of-fit, slopes, hypotheses tests, confidence intervals).

4. Conduct model diagnostics for the final model obtained in part 3. If issues are detected - proceed to transform/enhance your model from part 3 in order to try fixing them. Make sure to verify that the issues got fixed (or at least improved upon).
Afterwards, conduct a statistical test comparing your final models from parts 3 and 4.

5. Check for influential observations, verify their effect on resulting estimates/inference, treat them ac- cordingly.

6. Fit a basic multiple logistic regression model (only first-order terms, no polynomials or interactions), using all the tools learnt in class:
• Check for model significance 
• Variable selection
• Checking for collinearity
Interpret the results (model accuracy, slopes, hypotheses tests, confidence intervals).
